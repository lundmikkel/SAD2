Actor rating
-----------

* New is always better. New movies count more than old movies.
* Being in many movies is good.
* Based on how many movies and the rating of the movies.
* Based on the rating of the actors in the movies.


Movie budget
-----

Best possible movie with a given budget (quality of actors?)


**Idea**

Rate an actor based on a movie that he was in compared to the most similar movie that the actor was *not* in.
